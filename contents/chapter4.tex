\section{Algotithm Design}

\subsection{Algotithm Summay}
%
For the project management issues given above, this paper uses the
evolutionary algorithm to solve. Two important steps in using the
evolutionary algorithm are to encode the problem solution and to
choose the appropriate fitness evaluation function. Figure 6 shows the
process of allocating resources to all the work packages in a project
by simulation.  First, the work package after decomposition of the
project WBS is preprocessed to get the corresponding work package
priority sequence, and then according to the dependency of the work
package and the limit of resource allocation to schedule the progress
of each work package, and finally to calculate the total duration of
the simulation.

\subsection{The Form of Solution}
%
For the above-mentioned process of problem solving, we must first
determine the form of solution. This article uses Work Package
Priority (hereinafter referred to as WPP) to represent a solution of
project management issues. The form of such a solution is actually an
arrangement of the work packages in all the items, and the solution
space for the items containing the N work packages contains N
solutions, which is a very large search space.

%This is a figure 7

Figure 7 shows a specific solution, the solution of the coding that
represents the work package sequence gives the priority ranking of the
work package arrangement T1, T5, T6, T4, T8, T3, T9, T2, T7. This
coding method is conducive to programming and can be a favorable means
for the selection of the optimal solution.


\subsection{Fitness Assessment}
%
Through the form of the above coding about solution, each individual
coding form is a WPP. We get a work package sequence called S by
simulating the assignment of the work package sequence which is to
simulate the corresponding resource of the WPP. Then calculate the
total duration corresponding to the sequence of the work package. The
value of the total duration is used as evaluation to the individual in
the population.

For the solution of the total duration that is corresponding to a WPP
is as follows, first according to the types of resources that the
various work packages need to allocate in the resource diagram and the
workload of each work package, it will execute allocation of resources
for the priority of each individual work package coding. After the
allocation, each work package will have the start time and end
time. Then the maximum execution time for all work packages is the
total duration of the project.
