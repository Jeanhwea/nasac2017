\section{Conclusions and Future Works}
%
This paper proposes the use of Cooperative Co-Evolutionary Algorithms (CCEA) to solve software project planning and staffing problems.
The co-evolutionary algorithm evolves two populations, one representing WP ordering in a queue (which determines
their assignment to teams), and the other representing developers distribution among
teams.

We conducted an empirical study using data from four industrial software projects, aimed at comparing CCEA project planning and staffing with (i) random search and (ii) single population optimization using genetic algorithms, as previously proposed by Di Penta et al. [13].
Results of the empirical study show that CCEA is able to outperform random search and single population GA, in terms of effectiveness (i.e., best solutions proposed in terms of project completion time) and efficiency (i.e., a smaller number of
evaluations required).

Future work aims at extending the study reported in this paper with further data sets and, above all, at considering a more sophisticated project model, which accounts for further factors not considered in this study, such as developers? skills and expertise, communication overhead models, and schedule robustness.
