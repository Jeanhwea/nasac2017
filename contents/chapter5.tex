\section{Experimental Results}
%
To assess the evolutionary algorithm proposed in this paper, two separated
evaluation experiments are made for the efficiency of parallel evolutionary
algorithm and the validity of evolutionary algorithm in project management
problem. The purpose of the experiment is to answer the following two research
questions:


\textbf{RQ1}: Does the evolutionary algorithm effectively optimize project
management problem, and get an optimized answer?

\textbf{RQ2}: Is the parallel evolutionary algorithm able to improve the
efficiency in the project management problem?


\subsection{Industrial Project Data}
%
The experimental data evaluated in this paper are real industrial project
management plans.


A total number of three sets of industrial data have been used in the empirical
studies for this paper, which are named as \emph{A-Input}, \emph{B-DBUpgrade}
and \emph{C-SmartPrice}. These data come form real world peogects and have
fundamental details such as: number of work packages, required skills and staff.
Figure 4 shows the dependency graph that visualises the interdependency among
WPS, resource and efforts required by each WPS, and critical path of each
project. \emph{A-Input} is a simulated medium-scale project planning. The goal
of \emph{B-DBUpgrade} is to upgrade the Oracle database from the \emph{9g}
version to the \emph{10g} version, which is Oracle's non-public version of the
project planning. There were different layers of the organisation involved
including DBAs, BSAs, developers and users.  Furthermore, the project also
included the training of the staff for the new features of the system.
\emph{C-SmartPrice} consists of a supply chain enhancement of medium size
affecting mostly the website as well as a few internal applications. \cite{ren}.
The configuration of the projects is shown in Table \ref{tab:statis}.

\subsection{Effectiveness Experiment for Algorithm}
%
In order to answer \textbf{RQ1}, this section designs a effectiveness experiment
for evolutionary algorithm. The basic configuration used in the experiment is
that \emph{100} individuals runs in \emph{50} generations. For each generation
in the evolutionary algorithm, we counts the each individuals' fitness value in
the whole population, and then plot the statistical data into a boxplot diagram.


Each generation of the boxplot shows the five statistical data of all
individuals' fitness value in the whole population: the minimum, the lower
quartile, the median, the upper quartile and the maximum. Boxplot about the
above-mentioned three industrial projects is shown in figures \ref{fig:pj}. From
the trend of three projects, it can be seen that the population is diversified
when the population is initialized. As the number of generation increase, all
the fitness value begins to decrease, and finally converges to a optimized
result.

    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figures/fig_pa3.eps}
  }
  \caption{Statistics of Fitness Value in Each Generation}

\end{figure}


Through the above analysis results of experimental data, we can accurately
answer \textbf{RQ1}. In the project management problems, the evolutionary
algorithm does have a good optimization and improvement.


\subsection{Efficiency Experiment for Algorithm}
%
In order to answer \textbf{RQ2}, this section conduct a efficiency experiment
that compares the efficiency between the parallel evolutionary algorithm and the
sequential one.

The hardware environment of this experiment is as follows: the runtime
environment that execute the sequential evolutionary algorithm is the Intel i7
series CPU (abbreviated as CPU). The runtime environment of the parallel
evolutionary algorithm is the NVidia GeForce series GPU (abbreviated as GPU
). CPU and GPU detailed configuration comparison see Table \ref{tab:cpugpu}. The
software environment of this experiment is: Window 7 Ultimate Service Pack 1,
Microsoft Visual Studio 2012 C++ Compiler, CUDA 7.0.28 Runtime compilation
environment.

\begin{table}[!ht]
  \centering
  \caption{Hardware Configuration Comparison}
  \label{tab:cpugpu}
  \begin{tabular}{c|c}
    \hline
    CPU & GPU  \\
    \hline

    2.93 GHz & 1.27 GHz \\
    8 cores & 1664 cores \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

The initial configuration of the two versions is the identical, which the number
of population is 1000 and the number of generation is 100. Each generation
includes crossover, mutation and selection. A timer is set to record the total
time consuming of the algorithms. The timer starts after loading initial data
and ends after the result is calculated. This allows us to count the total
computational time both in the sequential environment and the parallel
environment under the same criteria.

The efficiency experiments are repeated $10$ times.  The final result of
\emph{A-Input}, \emph{B-DBUpgrade} and \emph{C-SmartPrice} are shown in figures
\ref{fig:co}. It can be seen from the figures that the time-consuming of the
sequential algorithm on CPU is roughly twice as long as the parallel algorithm
on GPU. So it can be a good answer to \textbf{RQ2} that parallel evolutionary
algorithm can improve the efficiency on computing the project management
problems.
