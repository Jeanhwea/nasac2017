\chapter*{Preface}
%
This textbook is intended for use by students of physics, physical
chemistry, and theoretical chemistry. The reader is presumed to have a
basic knowledge of atomic and quantum physics at the level provided, for
example, by the first few chapters in our book {\it The Physics of Atoms
and Quanta}. The student of physics will find here material which should
be included in the basic education of every physicist. This book should
furthermore allow students to acquire an appreciation of the breadth and
variety within the field of molecular physics and its future as a
fascinating area of research.

For the student of chemistry, the concepts introduced in this book will
provide a theoretical framework for that entire field of study. With the
help of these concepts, it is at least in principle possible to reduce
the enormous body of empirical chemical knowledge to a few basic
principles: those of quantum mechanics. In addition, modern physical
methods whose fundamentals are introduced here are becoming increasingly
important in chemistry and now represent indispensable tools for the
chemist.
